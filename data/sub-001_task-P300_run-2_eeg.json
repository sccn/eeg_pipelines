  "TaskDescription": "Participants were instructed to close their eyes and respond to oddball sounds. There were 3 types of sounds interspaced by about 1 second each, standard (500 Hz pure sounds lasting 60 ms), oddball (1000 Hz pure sounds lasting 60 ms), or distractor sounds (white noise lasting 60 ms). Participants were instructed to press a keypad on their lap when hearing an oddball and to ignore other types of stimuli. See experimental code for additional details."
